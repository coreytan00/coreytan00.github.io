	    		<p>
	    			I created an AI for the game of Checkers for my Intro to AI course in Fall '20. The AI is implemented with Monte Carlo Tree Search, performing approximately 35 simulations a second, and is supervised by greedy pruning.

	    		<h2>Network packet sniffer</h2>
	    		<p>
	    			Frustrated that I had issues with my latency while playing League 
	    			of Legends, I sought to figure out what was wrong with my network connection. I suspected that it may have been a bandwidth issue, so I coded a packet sniffer that captures all traffic going in and out. Of course I could simply use a program like WireShark, but why not code it instaed? The user can specify the running time of the sniffer and is provided data about the amount of data caught in Megabits and the bandwidth usage during that time. Additionally, all ipv4 packets caught are written into a text file in detail. Upon completion of the project, I determined that bandwitdth was unfortunately not the issue, and the secret perpetrator is still out there.

	    		<p>
		    		I developed a search engine from scratch that is capable of handling tens of thousands of documents or web pages. It returns accurate search results with a query response time under 200ms by utilizing page rank, word stemming, bookkeeping, weighted tf-idf and simhash. Documents were stored in an inverted index for ease of access.

	    		<p>
	    			During my freshman year at UCI, I had the great opportunity to witness the birth of school culture. Petr is a funny looking cartoon character of our school's mascot, Peter the Anteater. A mystery student clad in a black and a red beanie began distributing petr stickers to UCI students at a random time and place. Petr stickers took the campus by storm. In HackUCI 2020, my team and I programmed a simple video game around Petr, inspired by Final Fantasy, Oregon Trail, and Slay the Spire.

	    		<h2>Web Development: Acacia</h2>
	    		<p>
	    			This is one of my first big personal projects! Fundamentally a web application that is concerned with simplifying the G-suite products by condensing them into one site with a tasklist and note section incorporated. Originally, I launched it on Firebase before switching to Heroku to use its built-in PostgreSQL for my authentication database. Unfortunately to this day, it is still not completely finished and is on hiatus.

	    			<p>
	    				Repunzel is an image recognition pun generator created during my very first hackathon, LA Hacks 2019. This Android app allows the user to take a picture and then select a generated pun caption relating to the captured photo. What's crazy is the fact that we started learing Java 24 hours before attending the hackathon in order to use Android Studio to create a mobile application! We still managed to develop a fully functional application that we are very proud of in the end.
